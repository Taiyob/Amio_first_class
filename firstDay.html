<p>Seven named storms, of which three became hurricanes,
 formed during the below-average 1994 Atlantic hurricane season.
 The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30,
 dates that conventionally limit the period of each year when 
 tropical cyclones tend to form in the Atlantic. The first named
 storm of the year, Tropical Storm Alberto, formed on June 30.
 The last storm of the season, Hurricane Gordon (pictured), 
 dissipated on November 21. Alberto produced significant 
 rainfall and flooding in the Southeastern United States,
 damaging or destroying more than 18,000 homes, 
 and inflicting $750 million <b>(1994 USD)</b> in damages.
 Gordon caused damages from Costa Rica to North 
 Carolina in its six landfalls; extreme flooding
 and mudslides from the storm caused about <strong>1,122</strong>
 fatalities in Haiti. </p>
